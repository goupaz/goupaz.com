## Java Overview

Java is a general purpose, staticly typed, object oriented programming language
that was founded in June 1991. The project was initiated by three
developers - James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, but
was officially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

Java's tagline is "Write once, run anywhere", and the language was
founded on 5 principles

1. It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
2. It must be "robust and secure".
3. It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
4. It must execute with "high performance".
5. It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".

### How Java Runs

All java code is compiled down into java byte code which is then
run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This ensures that java programs
can be run on virtually any combination of hardware and operating
system.

Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory, and the
syntax of java is largly influenced by c & c++.

Java is perhaps best known for being the language in which android
apps are written, and also seves as the basis for several popular
frameworks including Spring and Hibernate. Java is also known for
having an extensive ecosystem, with libraries and API's to do just
about anything.

### Choosing an IDE

Many developers choose to write java using a specilized integrated
development enviornment. Three of the most popular are Eclipse,
NetBeans and IntelliJ.
